# Yune
Compiler for the Yune programming language

The Yune programming language promotes usage of Domain Specific Languages through the use of macros rather than trying to be a single monolithic language that has every feature imaginable. Yune compiles to C and has memory safety based on Rust's. All data in Yune itself is abstract by default, which allows for low-cost interactions with other languages and interfaces for free.

Yune uses the ".un" (pronounced "dot yune") file extension.

# WIP
Very Work-In-Progress. The language's syntax itself is not yet stable, but it is converging. The parser is the current focus of development.
