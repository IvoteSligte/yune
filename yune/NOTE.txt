compilation order of a function
	1. type check the header (depends on types used in header)
	2. type check the body (depends on types and types of globals used in body)
 
compilation order of a constant
	1. type check the type annotation (depends on types used in type annotation)
	2. type check the body (depends on types and types of globals used in body)
	3. if required at compile-time, calculate value of constant

dependency kinds
	type->value
		declaration // the type of a declaration depends on the values of its type annotations

	value->type  // everything at the type checking step

	value->value // a global constant value is used in the body of a declaration
		expression // variable use or function call that rely on global declarations
