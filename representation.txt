primitives
	// LLVM primitives
	integer (signed/unsigned, any bit-width)
	float (16, 32, 64, 128 bits)
	ptr<T>

compounds
	untagged union // not preferred, but necessary to represent existing types
	tagged union
	tuple 		   // can represent struct/record, maybe with special sugar too
	array

operations
	integer / float
		arithmetic
	(tagged) union / tuple / array
		get element at index

transformations
	// need to represent an arbitrary transformation on a datastructure
	// in a way that it is possible that the output is of the correct format

// essentially, we need to know where the relevant data is in the input
// and what transformation to apply to that data to get the output

// provable preconditions and postconditions, in short
// or just postconditions, since preconditions are not provable as the data is generated
// by arbitrary code

// data locations matter in a representation, but relevant data is not always next to each other
// for example, a tagged union may be split into two parts: the tag and the union,
// and these parts can be anywhere in the input
