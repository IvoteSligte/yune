1. no runtime: compile to C++
	utilise C/C++ features to connect with many languages
	bindings for some languages so that they can call Yune code

2. representation-agnostic programming
	zero-cost data flow between host and (single) DSL; requires solver for max performance
	language A representation of object A(object) and language B representation of object B(object)
		A(object) -> Yune(object) -> B(object)

3. bridge between languages instead of host language

4. runtime modifications (mods)
	arbitrarily extending program code at runtime
	though maybe compile-time safety for this would be great
	basically any interpreted language supports this

5. ANTLR grammar integration
	immediately allows parsing all popular languages

6. also allow running macros on separate files (imports)

7. docker/nix integration

8. DSL contruction language with type checking

syntax contenders: Racket/Nemerle/Nim/Elixir/Ocaml(ppx)/Rust/Common Lisp/Haskell(template haskell with quasiquotes)

Nemerle directly puts generated code in calling scope
	Yune is hygienically superior by construction
